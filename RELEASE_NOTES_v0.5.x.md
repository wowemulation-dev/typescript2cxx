## Version 0.5.0 - Project Organization & E2E Testing

_Released: 2025-08-07_

### Overview

Version 0.5.0 focuses on project organization, developer experience, and comprehensive end-to-end testing. This release consolidates scattered output directories, improves test infrastructure, and ensures the complete TypeScript → C++ → Binary compilation pipeline works reliably.

### Major Improvements

#### Project Organization

- **Unified output structure**: All generated files now organized under `.output/` directory
  - **Before**: 8+ scattered directories (`cmake-test-output/`, `cov_profile/`, `coverage.lcov`, `e2e-cmake-test/`, etc.)
  - **After**: Single consolidated structure with logical subdirectories

  ```
  .output/
  ├── coverage/         # Test coverage data  
  ├── dist/             # Compiled CLI executable
  ├── docs/             # Generated API documentation
  ├── cmake-tests/      # CMake integration test results
  ├── reports/          # Test reports and analysis
  └── README.md         # Self-documenting structure
  ```

- **Configuration simplification**:
  - **gitignore**: Single `/.output/` entry instead of 8+ scattered patterns
  - **deno.json**: All task outputs consolidated to `.output/` subdirectories
  - **Lint/format exclusions**: Single `.output/` exclusion

#### Test Infrastructure Enhancement

- Performance optimizations for large codebases
- Module system improvements
- Enhanced error reporting and debugging

### Migration Guide

#### From v0.4.x

1. **Update CI/CD scripts** that reference old output paths:
   ```bash
   # Old paths
   ./dist/typescript2cxx          → .output/dist/typescript2cxx
   ./docs/                        → .output/docs/
   ./cmake-test-output/           → .output/cmake-tests/
   ./cov_profile/                 → .output/coverage/
   ```

2. **Clean old directories** (optional):
   ```bash
   rm -rf dist docs cmake-test-output cov_profile coverage.lcov
   ```

3. **Update any tooling** that expects output in old locations

4. **No code changes required** - all APIs remain the same
