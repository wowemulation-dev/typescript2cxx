## Version 0.2.0 - Enhanced TypeScript Support & Core Features

_Released: 2025-01-06_

### Overview

Version 0.2.0 focused on expanding TypeScript language support with advanced control flow, enhanced class features, and comprehensive testing infrastructure.

### Major Features

#### Control Flow Enhancements

- **For loops**: Classic for, for...of, and for...in loops with proper scoping
- **While/Do-While loops**: Complete loop support with break/continue
- **Switch statements**: Full switch/case/default with fall-through semantics
- **Enhanced conditionals**: Ternary operators and complex boolean expressions

#### Class System Improvements

- **Constructor support**: Proper constructor generation with parameter lists
- **Method implementations**: Instance and static methods with correct binding
- **Property declarations**: Public, private, protected member variables
- **This binding**: Correct `this` context in methods and arrow functions
- **Class expressions**: Support for anonymous class expressions

#### Expression Handling

- **Binary operators**: Full arithmetic, logical, and comparison operators
- **Unary operators**: ++, --, !, ~, typeof, void, delete
- **Assignment operators**: +=, -=, *=, /=, %=, etc.
- **Logical operators**: &&, ||, ?? with short-circuit evaluation
- **Member access**: Property access with dots and brackets
- **Call expressions**: Function and method calls with arguments

#### Type System Foundation

- **Basic type annotations**: string, number, boolean, any, void
- **Array types**: T[] and Array<T> syntax support
- **Object types**: Interface and type alias foundations
- **Function types**: Parameter and return type annotations
- **Union types**: Basic union type support (string | number)

### Testing Infrastructure

- **Spec-based testing**: BDD-style test specifications
- **Test categories**: Organized tests by feature area
- **Coverage tracking**: Code coverage metrics and reporting
- **E2E test framework**: End-to-end transpilation testing

### Code Quality

- **Linting rules**: Comprehensive ESLint configuration
- **Format standards**: Consistent code formatting with deno fmt
- **Type checking**: Strict TypeScript checking enabled
- **CI/CD pipeline**: GitHub Actions for automated testing
